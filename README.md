# ConservationCoin
Description:
  - 1 Coin = 1mÂ² of soil
  - it should be easily tradeble on the markets

Arguments:
  - Pros:
    - based on real assets
    - good for nature
  
  - Cons:
    - Liquification:
      - you cannot distribute the land back to the holders in equal pieces because it's legal nightmare with small amounts.
    - furthermore buying new soil has to be done carefully, with a good eye on value
    - legal bridge might be difficult

What to look out for:
  - how will we handle transaction fees? probably by the fee going back into the company we can cover the cost.
  - selling everything might result in less than original price.
  - value evaluation every now and then ? Mybe once a year throw out an estimate on total value. That way coin holders see which price is right.
  - the Currency is expandable
  - how to handle someone wanting to trade soil in for coins. Who handles it. It cannot be done unsupervised.
  - figuring a good tool out to estimate protected zone area.
  - If land is bought. Who makes sure it stays unmolested:
    - Someone looking on Google Maps?
  - Financing: sustainable forestry?, 

Approach:
  - It is most likely going to be build with 'Cosmos' or openzeppelin
  - Liquification:
      - 1: everyone gets land based on the value it was bought for
      - 2: all land gets sold and the money is getting distributed with coin-ownership/total-coin-amount%.
  - there needs to be a google maps overlay which shows all the owned areas!
