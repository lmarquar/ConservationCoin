# ConservationCoin
Description:
  - 1 Coin = 1â‚¬ worth of soil at the point of buying.
  - it should be easily tradeble on the markets

Arguments:
  - Pros:
    - based on real assets
    - good for nature
  
  - Cons:
    - Liquification:
      - not all soil is equal. the customer might end up with a piece he ain't happy with
      - you cannot distribute the land back to the holders in equal pieces because it's legal nightmare with small amounts.
    - furthermore buying new soil has to be done carefully, with a good eye on value

What to look out for:
  - the Currency is expandable
  - how to handle someone wanting to trade soil in for coins. Who handles it. It cannot be done unsupervised.
  - figuring a good tool out to estimate protected zone area.
  - If land is bought. Who makes sure it stays unused:
    - Someone looking on Google Maps?

Approach:
  - It is most likely going to be build with 'Cosmos'
  - Liquification:
      - 1: everyone gets land based on the value it was bought for
      - 2: all land gets sold and the money is getting distributed with coin-ownership/total-coin-amount%.
